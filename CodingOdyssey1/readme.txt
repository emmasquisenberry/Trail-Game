For this coding Odyssey, I decided to make my own version of the Oregon Trail!
sprite.py has all of my classes and definitions.
eventchances.py has all of the random events that can happen.
loop.py has the main core of the game—this is where you will play the game.
test_game.py is where you can perform a unit test.
inventory.py contains the code for the inventory
store.py contains the code for the store.
Some of the functions in the store are not entirely functional at this time besides food, but you can still buy them.

The game itself lets you name yourself, select your pace, and select your rations at the beginning of the game.
Each turn, you will be given the option to change any settings, and to continue or rest.
Every 10 miles, you will run into a store where you can buy things.
